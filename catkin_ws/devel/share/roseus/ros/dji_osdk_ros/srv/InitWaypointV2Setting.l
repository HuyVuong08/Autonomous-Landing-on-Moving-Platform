# While the aircraft is travelling between waypoints, you can offset its speed by
# using the throttle joystick on the remote controller. \"maxFlightSpeed\" is this
# offset when the joystick is pushed to maximum deflection. For example, If
# maxFlightSpeed is 10 m/s, then pushing the throttle joystick all the way up will
# add 10 m/s to the aircraft speed, while pushing down will subtract 10 m/s from
# the aircraft speed. If the remote controller stick is not at maximum deflection,
# then the offset speed will be interpolated between \"[0, maxFlightSpeed]\"\" with a
# resolution of 1000 steps. If the offset speed is negative, then the aircraft
# will fly backwards to previous waypoints. When it reaches the first waypoint, it
# will then hover in place until a positive speed is applied. \"maxFlightSpeed\" has
# a range of [2,15] m/s.

# range [-15, 15] m/s. The aircraft's actual speed is a combination of the base
# automatic speed, and the speed control given by the throttle joystick on the
# remote controller. If \"autoFlightSpeed >0\": Actual speed is \"autoFlightSpeed\" +
# Joystick Speed (with combined max of \"maxFlightSpeed\") If \"autoFlightSpeed =0\":
# Actual speed is controlled only by the remote controller joystick. If
# autoFlightSpeed <0\" and the aircraft is at the first waypoint, the aircraft
# will hover in place until the speed is made positive by the remote controller
# joystick. In flight controller firmware 3.2.10.0 or above, different speeds
# between individual waypoints can also be set in waypoint objects which will
