# ar_helipad
A ROS package that is used to detect helipads (landing zones) that have one or two (bundled) AR tags. After detection, it reports back the center of the landing zone, and visualizes both the marker and the whole zone using visualization markers in rViz.

It is part of a ROS eco-system of packages that allow an autonomous UAV to land on a moving platform, using only a front-facing camera.
